# ActionScript 3 and MXML for Nova

üöÄ **Work In Progress** üöÄ

This extension brings **ActionScript 3 and MXML** support to **Panic Nova**.

üÜï Version 0.11: Introduced SDK list management and per-Task SDK selection.

The goal was to be able to use all of my old Adobe Flash Builder projects and convert them to Nova's workflow. I wanted to be able to build and run projects in Nova without additional setup, just by importing the Flash Builder settings when opening the project. (It's pretty close to it!)

## ‚òëÔ∏è Todo

- **MXML** - Nova shows the MXML fine on first load, however, after saving it sometime flags a lot of issues.
- **Launching AIR projects on actual devices** - Android and iOS
- **Locale** - Currently set to use en_US
- **Themes** - Importing Flash Builder projects should store the right value, but currently not honored during builds.
- **Library** - Automatically managing library builds
- **Workers & Modules** - I personally never used them, but if you want to help out and have a project that did, contact me!

## üìù Notes

For Issues, Language Intelligence and Completions, the LSP used is [BowlerHatLLC/vscode-as3mxml](https://github.com/BowlerHatLLC/vscode-as3mxml) V1.22.0.

AS3MXML requires an `asconfig.json` in the project folder. The extension will ask when opening the project if it should attempt to auto-generate one or if you prefer to maintain it manually. _NOTE:_ If you have used the VSCode extension, and have one already, you can disable the automatic generation but if you switch between Tasks it may not function properly.

For Debugging, [Bowler Hat's SWF Debug](https://github.com/BowlerHatLLC/vscode-swf-debug) V1.10.0 is used.

For Cleaning/Building/Running and Export Packaging are done by this extension using binaries from the (Harman) Adobe Air or Flex SDK:
- `mxmlc` for compiling of Flash and AIR project and packaging,
- `compc` is used for compiling libraries
- `adt` is used for running (checking for devices and making certificates)

## üìã Requirements

ActionScript 3 and MXML for Nova requires the following (besides Nova) to be installed on your Mac:

- **Java (JDK 11+)** - AS3MXML requires it, and it also avoids issues with `mxmlc` in some SDKs returning `"Error: null"` when using Java 1.8.

- **(Harman) Adobe Air** or **Flex SDK** - Default path is `~/Applications/AIRSDK` (but can be changed by installing SDKs)

- **Rosetta 2** (for Apple Silicon Macs) - Required to run SDK tools

### Optional

These are only needed if you plan on running Flash Player projects:

- **Flash Player** (Standalone) - If trying to run Flash projects

- **Ruffle** - Can also run Flash projects. _NOTE:_ There may be some additional prompting to allow it to run the projects if you launch it from Nova.

- **Old Chrome/Chromium with PPAPI Flash Player** - Version prior to V88 should be able to run in browser

## üöÄ Usage

Open an `*.as`, or `*.mxml` and it should work. However, there are a few things that need to be setup to get the full functionality:

![](assets/no-sdk.png)

### üß© SDK Setup

Starting with v0.11, SDKs are now managed through a global SDK list, making it easier to install, remove, and select AIR or Flex SDKs without manually editing paths. Once SDKs are installed, you can even select which SDK to use per Task if needed.

If you‚Äôre upgrading from an earlier version, your previous `Default SDK` is automatically migrated into the `Installed SDKs` list.

The first SDK in that list now acts as your default SDK.

#### Managing SDKs

Although you can edit the `Installed SDKs` list manually, it‚Äôs recommended to use these commands instead, either from the **Extensions ‚Üí ActionScript 3** menu or the Command Palette:

 - **`‚ûï Install SDK`** - Use to add an SDK. If you already have one installed, it will ask whether to make it the new default or simply add it.
 - **`‚úîÔ∏è Change Default SDK`** - Sets which SDK acts as the default. If a project or task doesn't specify one, this SDK will be used.
 - **`‚ûñ Remove SDK`** - When removing, you‚Äôll be prompted to select which SDK to delete from the list. If you remove the first SDK in the list (the Default SDK), the extension automatically promotes the next SDK and displays a notification.
 - **`‚û∞ Reset SDK List`** - This removes all installed SDKs and will look for one in `~/Applications/AIRSDK`

After installation, the SDK appears in your `Installed SDKs` list in the extension‚Äôs preferences.

The first SDK in the `Installed SDKs` is always treated as the Default SDK, unless a specific one is set in the Project or Task preferences.

#### Managing Installed SDKs Manually

You can view or modify your installed SDKs manually:

 1.	Go to **Extensions ‚Üí Extension Library...**
 2.	Select **ActionScript 3**, then open the Preferences tab
 3.	Scroll to `Installed SDKs` to view or edit the list

To change the Default SDK, make sure you drag the path up to the top of the list!

#### SDK Selection per Task

Each Task (except Library Tasks) can use its own SDK, selectable from a dropdown in the Task Preferences.
This allows you to build different targets (desktop, mobile, web) with different SDK versions within the same project.

To configure it:

 1. Go to **Project ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Edit Task...**
 2. Select the _Task_ (e.g. AIR - Desktop, AIR - Android, Flash, etc.)
 3. Under Use a specific SDK for this task, choose an SDK from the dropdown.

If set to _None_, the Task automatically uses the default SDK (the first entry in the `Installed SDKs` list).

Library Tasks always use the Project SDK and cannot override it.

### Code Intelligence and Issues

Since the LSP AS3MXML requires an `asconfig.json` for code intelligence,  completions, and issues, you will need a file in your project's root. When opening a project you will get prompted:

![](assets/asconfig-prompt.png)

- **Automatic** - If you select this, when project's settings are changed, the extension will modify the `asconfig.json`. If there is an existing `asconfig.json`, it will be backed up and timestamped.

- **I'll Maintain it** - This will not create or modify an `asconfig.json` file. Just remember, you need one for code intelligence and issues!

- **Cancel** - Skip, but will prompt you every time you open the project.

If the extension handles your `asconfig.json`, only the options used by this extension are changed. Since the building is not handled by AS3MXML, most of the compiling and packaging setting are not modified.

### Making Nova feel more like Flash Builder

There are some additional options to make Nova feel more Flash Builder like are also options that you can change. These will affect projects that have been either created with this extension or imported from Flash Builder:

- **Open output on run** - This opens the report window when you run a Task, similar to the Console window in Flash Builder

- **Build on run** - This will force building before running

## ‚öôÔ∏è Import Flash Builder project

While Flex Builder / Flash Builder are no longer supported by Adobe, this extension allows users to migrate their existing project for use in Panic Nova. If your project contains  `.actionScriptProperties`, `.project`, and `.flexProperies` or `.flexLibProperies`, the extension defaults to prompting you to import the settings:

![](assets/fb-detected.png)

- **Yes** - Converts the Flash Builder project and modify the Nova project's settings.

- **Never** - Will not import and won't ask again.

- **Cancel** - Will not import, but will ask you next time.

If you want, you can also change this setting in the **Extensions ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Additional Options... ‚Üí Prompt to import Flash Builder projects** and disable it.

You can also use the menu option **Extensions ‚Üí ActionScript 3 ‚Üí Import Flash Builder project...** to change your project's settings to those used by a Flash Builder project whenever you need to.

#### SDKs

If the import reads the name of the SDK from the Flash Builder project, it will first remind you that it cannot find your project's SDK settings:

![](assets/check-sdk.png)

Then it will prompt you with:

![](assets/check-sdk-options.png)

- **Install an SDK** - Will bring up the requestor to install an SDK.
- **Remove this setting** - Will remove the setting in the Nova project (not the imported Flash Builder one) which will end up using the Default SDK.
- **Ignore for now** - This will just dismiss the message. If you need to either install it yourself or will have to change the project's SDK setting:

   1. Go into your **Project ‚Üí Project Settings...**
   2. Scroll down to the **Compiler ‚Üí AIR/Flex SDK version**.

   ![](assets/compiler-sdk-options.png)

#### Additional Notes about project import

The importing may also import may also setup more Tasks than needed, especially if was a mobile project. If you run into building issues like below, it may be that you need to change the Task to a mobile device Task and try building/running. Feel free to remove the desktop AIR task.

![](assets/not-mobile.png)

### Old Flex/AIR SDKs

Prior to AIR SDK 20, some of the executables were still 32bit. Unfortunately, these won't run on anything after Mac OS 10.5. If you are using an older version of an SDK, you will get a warning about this:

  ![](assets/32bit-air.png)

 - **Understood** - The message will pop up every time you open the project
 - **Don't Remind Me** - This will not show up again, unless you change the SDK that is being used. It will be reset every time you change SDKs.

That doesn't mean it won't still build, but if you try to play or package it, it may fail:

![](assets/air-failed.png)

Click on the show reports and if you see something like this:

![](assets/task-output.png)

This means that ADL is still 32bit, and won't run. If you want to also run from Nova, you will need to update your SDK to AIR 20+. Then you will need to update your *app.xml* for the namespace, but if it's really old you may need to include a `<versionNumber>` element (and make sure it's only numbers). Don't worry, the extension should remind you!

![](assets/descriptor-update.png)

## üÜï New Projects

You can also use the menu option **Extensions ‚Üí ActionScript 3 ‚Üí Create New AS3/Flex Project...**.

- **Flex Projects** - Creates an MXML based project. It will ask if you want to make it an **AIR** or **Flash** based project.

- **Flex Library** - Lets you create an ActionScript based library in one of two flavors:
  - **Generic** - Can be used with either web, desktop, or mobile projects
  - **Mobile** - Can only be used with mobile application

- **Flex Mobile Project** - Creates an MXML based mobile project, which you decide how the views are based:
  - **Tabbed** - Includes a tab bar to switch between views in the application
  - **View** - Offers different views that can be switched in the application
  - **Blank** - Simple, one view for displaying the application

- **ActionScript Project**  - It will ask if you want to make it an **AIR** or **Flash** based project.

- **ActionScript Mobile Project** - Creates an AIR based mobile application

## üé® Themes Support is _Incomplete_

### Halo Theme issues

_NOTE:_ Currently, when importing from Flash Builder it detects and stores theme information, but automatic inclusion during builds isn‚Äôt yet implemented!

There is an option that will allow you to build older Flex 3 projects that require embedding Halo with the build. If you try to build and run into errors that say something like  `is only supported by type ... with the theme(s)`, as shown here:

![](assets/halo-errors.png)

you can go to the project's preferences and check the option:

![](assets/themes-pref.png)

This will force `mxmlc` to compile and embed the Halo theme, allowing Flex 4 to set some styles that can only be modified if the `halo.swc` is compiled with it!

## üîê Certificates

The extension has the ability to generate certificates for self signing AIR packages using ADL. To create a self-signed certificate:
- Go to **Extensions ‚Üí ActionScript 3 ‚Üí Create new Certificate**

   Nova will then prompt you with several questions and allow you to generate a new self-signing certificate.

If your project or Tasks have certificates, you can store a certificate password in your Keychain:
- Go to **Extensions ‚Üí ActionScript 3 ‚Üí Store Certificate Password**

 If there is more than one certificate, you will get a prompt to select which certificate to store. You must do it one at a time.

To clear the certificate password from your Keychain:
- Go to **Extensions ‚Üí ActionScript 3 ‚Üí Clear Certificate Password**

 If you have stored one or more certificates, then it will prompt to select "All" or a particular certificate to remove.

## üì¶ Export Release Build

![](assets/export-package.png)

This allows you to package AIR projects. Make sure you have your certificate created, if not, then take a look above!

If you have multiple Tasks, and you try to export a release build it will ask which one you want. The extension will also store the last one selected, so it will pick that by default.

![](assets/export-package-selector.png)

Next, it will prompt you for you certificate password, and if it's good, it will ask you if you want to use it just this one time, save it to your Keychain, or use for the session.

### Android Air Flair

By default, when packaging for Android, `air.` is prepended to the application ID. This can be toggled in the Android Task.

![](assets/air-flair.png)

### Timestamp Errors

One minute it works, next minute it doesn't.

![](assets/timestamp-error.png)

If just testing locally on your own devices, you can just change the project's settings to skip the timestamp or you can supply your own  RFC3161-compliant timestamp server URL. Go to

 1. **Project ‚Üí Project Settings...**
 2. Scroll down to the **Build Packaging** section:

![](assets/timestamp-prefs.png)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Remember, there's a ton of configs, and in different places:

 - **Global preferences** - Open **Extensions ‚Üí Extension Library...** then select ActionScript 3's **Preferences** tab.

 - **Project preferences** - You can also configure preferences on a per-project basis in **Project ‚Üí Project Settings...**.

 - **Task preferences** - Tasks also have a bunch of options too! Don't miss out on **Project ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Edit Task...** or if you click on the Task dropdown and selecting **Edit Task...** and then selecting the appropriate Task.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Tasks

### Application Tasks

Tasks play an important role in build/run as well as exporting of packages. There are different ones available, based on how you plan to run and or package your project. Each project can also include multiple Task, so you can easily switch between building one project for multiple devices. The option to Export Release Build will ask which Task to export.

As of v0.8.2, you can now set custom build/run main application files and destination folders, allowing you to build/launch multiple Tasks at the same time with a different project.

As of v0.11.0, you can now specify a specific SDK to use for that task.

This can be useful if you want to build and run a desktop, Android and iOS build from the same code base at the same time!

- ![](Images/as3-air/as3-air.png) **AIR** - Desktop builds.

- ![](Images/as3-android/as3-android.png)  **AIR - Android** - Packaging for Android devices.

- ![](Images/as3-ios/as3-ios.png)  **AIR - iOS** - Packaging for iOS devices.

- ![](Images/as3-flash/as3-flash.png)  **Flash** - Web Builds (supports SWFObject and Ruffle)

  If building a Flash project and using the Ruffle template for web, you will need to use Nova's External Preview option to run since Ruffle does not allow the use of `file:///` protocol for loading SWFs in a browser.

  Also, don't forget that closing the window on Flash Player, it does not quit it so Nova will still think the Task is running. If you go to run again, you may want to Stop so that it will only have one process running, or you can Add if you want to have multiple things open. It's kinda useful if you need to compare your changes.

  ![](assets/stop-flash.png)

  In the **Global preferences** setting, you can set up the locations of Flash Player, Ruffle, and a old browser to use for launching if you scroll down to the Flash Player Run/Debug section:

  ![](assets/flash-runners.png)

  If you edit the Task settings, you can change how to launch it:

  ![](assets/flash-launch-select.png)

### Flex Library Task

- ![](Images/as3-lib/as3-lib.png)  **Library** - This can be used to make an Flex library (*NOTE:* Not fully tested, and needs some more work.)

## üí° Tips and Tricks

### Viewing `trace()` output

 1. Going into **Project ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Edit Task...**
 2. Select the Task you want.
 3. Scroll all the way to the bottom, change the Task's **Open Report** drop down to **On Run**.

  ![](assets/open-report.png)

  Then a window with the output will show up when you run:

  ![](assets/trace-output.png)

### Force build before running

 1. Going into **Project ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Edit Task...**.
 2. Expand the Task you want to modify.
 3. Select the **Run** option.
 4. Then you can check off **Build before running**.
