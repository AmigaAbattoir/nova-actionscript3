**Experimental/ _(not)_ Work _(ing)_ In Progress** plugin that uses the ActionScript & MXML language server to provide code intelligence in Nova.

Based upon [BowlerHatLLC/vscode-as3mxml](https://github.com/BowlerHatLLC/vscode-as3mxml).

Started setting up LSP using the [https://github.com/BowlerHatLLC/vscode-as3mxml/wiki/How-to-use-the-ActionScript-and-MXML-language-server-with-Sublime-Text](How to use the ActionScript and MXML language server with Sublime Text
) from the repo's Wiki.

Also, took some stuff from [BowlerHatLLC/eclipse-as3mxml](https://github.com/BowlerHatLLC/eclipse-as3mxml/blob/master/language-configurations/actionscript.configuration.json)

`.tmLanguage` files converted using the converter [Nova Mate](https://github.com/gredman/novamate)

## Requirements

AS3MXML requires some additional tools to be installed on your Mac:

* Java

## Usage

Cross your fingers and hope it runs!

### Configuration

To configure global preferences, open **Extensions → Extension Library...** then select AS3MXML's **Preferences** tab, eventually.

You can also configure preferences on a per-project basis in **Project → Project Settings...**, eventually.
