# ActionScript 3 and MXML Extension for Panic's Nova

*(Currently a work in progress)*

Extension for ActionScript 3 and MXML in [Nova](https://nova.app/) using [Bowler Hat's AS3MXML](https://github.com/BowlerHatLLC/vscode-as3mxml) as the LSP.

It uses Tasks for cleaning/building/running, which can be set for either Flash, AIR, Android, or iOS.

It can import Flash Builder projects and generate these Tasks automatically, which then can be used to export release from these projects.

More details about ActionScript 3 for Nova are in the [actionscript3.novaextension README.md](actionscript3.novaextension/README.md)
